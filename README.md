# Support-Vector-Machines

SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes. 

At first approximation what SVMs do is to find a separating line(or hyperplane) between data of two classes. SVM is an algorithm that takes the data as an input and outputs a line that separates those classes if possible.

According to the SVM algorithm we find the points closest to the line from both the classes.These points are called support vectors. Now, we compute the distance between the line and the support vectors. This distance is called the margin. Our goal is to maximize the margin. The hyperplane for which the margin is maximum is the optimal hyperplane.Thus SVM tries to make a decision boundary in such a way that the separation between the two classes(that street) is as wide as possible.
